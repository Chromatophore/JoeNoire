none^I was never anybody. Never wanted to be.
none^Never wanted to stand out. Kept my head down.
none^Just wanted to be, you know, happy. But no.
none^Not worth dwelling on the past though, is it. Won't change nothing.
tannoy^Hey, Jack! Are you sleeping down there?! I don't pay you to sleep!

tannoy^Well welcome back to the land of the living!
tannoy^Sleep when your shift is over, not when it's starting!
jack^I wasn't sleeping, I was just... thinking.
tannoy^Well I don't pay you to THINK, although it'd certainly be cheaper.
none^IF you were paying me any less I'd be going home each night in debt.
tannoy^Well, let's get a move on then, you've got shipping boxes to label!

superboss^Welcome, Jack. I hope the boys have been treating you well.
jack^Better than their parents treated them, I'm sure.
superboss^Ha! Quite firey for someone in such dire straights.
goon1^Maybe if you had used some of that wit to win at cards you wouldn't be here now.
superboss^Yes, Jack, you are quite deep in debt to the house. Too deep.
superboss^I've heard the sad news about your recent unemployment as well.
superboss^It really does seem like you've run out of options.
superboss^And I've run out of patience.
superboss^Boys, I think it's time you take Jack here on one last ride.
lady^Hiiiii boys!
goon2^Heya Miss!
superboss^Darling, what have I said about needing my privacy during business meetings?
lady^Aw, but, I was getting so lonely! You never pay me any mind.
superboss^I pay much more than that! Gifts don't grow on trees, my dear.
lady^But, but it's so cold in the house, alone. My poor hands!
ladyh1^Especially this finger...
superboss^Well then... It's a good thing that I was just sending the boys out... with Jack here... to pick you up something nice!
lady^Aw, you were doing that for me?
superboss^Of course. Boys, you know what to do. Show Jack where I like to get gifts from.
