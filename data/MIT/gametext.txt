none^I was never anybody. Never wanted to be.
none^Never wanted to stand out, kept my head down.
none^Just wanted to be, you know, happy. But no.
none^Not worth dwelling on the past though, is it. Won't change nothing.
tannoy^Hey, Jack! You sleeping down there?! I don't pay you to sleep!

tannoy^Welcome back, Jack!
tannoy^Sleep when your shift is over, not when it's starting!
jack^I wasn't sleeping, I was just... thinking.
tannoy^I don't pay you to THINK, although it'd certainly be cheaper.
none^If you were paying me any less... I'm barely breaking even as it is.
tannoy^Let's get a move on, you've got shipping boxes to label!

text

tannoy^Just slap a label on already!
none^Right, Z to select a label, and X to put it on.

text
intro_4

none^What a charmed life. Placing labels on crates.
none^Now to move on to the next one. X on next.

text
intro_5

tannoy^C'mon! Are you even paying attention to shipping regulations?
none^Lousy arbitrary government nonsense.
none^Labels must be no more than 2 inches from nearest yadda yadda...

tannoy^Hey Jack, you look like you could use a break! Not that you'll get one, ha!
none^Can't drop these damned shakes again!
none^Just gotta hold C to relax. Focus on breathing.

marco^Hey Bossman, I need a few minutes to head outside for... a smoke.
tannoy^No worries, Marco. Jack will cover you!
none^Can't remember the last time I got a break.
none^Gotta do both labels now.
none^Gotta put one on then use Z to swap to the other.

tannoy^Alright, alright, finish up with those and move on to the international crates.

text

tannoy^This is the last domestic crate, try not to screw it up! International shipping is next.

text

jack^That's it! I've had it with this! Give me what I'm owed, and I'm out of here. I quit!
tannoy^What?? I'm coming down there!
workboss^That hurts! I give you an honest wage and an honest job, and all I get is abuse!
workboss^Take your money and get out of here. Don't come crawling back to me when you can't find anything better!

tannoy^That's it! I've seen enough! Here's the money you're owed for today, but don't come back. You're fired!

goon1^Heard the bad news.
goon2^Awful news.
goon1^No job, in this economy?
jack^Hey boys. Funny how fast news travels.
goon1^Oh, is it funny?
jack^Well, in the same way life's funny.
goon2^Your life seems a bit more sad than funny.
goon1^Nevermind that. Jack, you got a little debt that's come due.
goon2^Yeah, and lucky you, we've arranged transportation!
goon1^Got the van parked right outside.
goon2^Hold on, I need one for the road.

superboss^Welcome, Jack. I hope the boys have been treating you well.
jack^Better than their parents treated them, I'm sure.
superboss^Ha! Quite firey for someone in such dire straights.
goon1^Maybe if you had used some of that wit to win at cards you wouldn't be here now.
superboss^Yes, Jack, you are quite deep in debt to the house. Too deep.
superboss^I've heard the sad news about your recent unemployment as well.
superboss^It really does seem like you've run out of options.
superboss^And I've run out of patience.
shake^1,300^superboss^Boys, I think it's time you take Jack here on one last ride.

lady^Hiiiii boys!
goon2^Heya Miss!
superboss^Darling, what have I said about needing my privacy during business meetings?
lady^Aw, but, I was getting so lonely! You never pay me any mind.
superboss^I pay much more than that! Gifts don't grow on trees, my dear.
lady^But, but it's so cold in the house, alone. My poor hands!
ladyh1^Especially this finger...
superboss^Well then... It's a good thing that I was just sending the boys out... with Jack here... to pick you up something nice!
lady^Aw, you were doing that for me?
superboss^Of course. Boys, you know what to do. Show Jack where I like to get gifts from.

goon1^Wow, Jack, you should make sure to thank the lady next time you see her.
goon2^Yeah she really saved your bacon.
jack^Yeah, now I get to spend more time with you guys.
goon2^Exactly! Let's head to the jewelry store.
none^................. ..................
goon2^Alright Jack,
goon1^Hey, idiot, don't use his real name.
goon2^Oh, yeah. Because of cops!
goon1^Yes, very good, you've cracked the case.
goon1^So, since he's such a joker, let's call him Joe.

goon2^Okay, Joe, you may have noticed we've broken in.
goon1^In light of this, we've seen fit to furnish you with a gun.
goon2^For protection.
goon1^But don't get any bright ideas... Maybe we only put in one bullet.
goon2^And there's two of us!
goon1^Now, let's clean out these cases!

lady^No, no, no, these are all just wrong.
lady^No style! No... I don't know, No je ne sais quoi!
jack^I thought that first one was quite fetching, actually.
lady^That's because you're uncouth! What did you boys get?
ladyh2^Oooh, now this one I like! It has a burning passion!
ladyh3^But, still, my poor barren arm...
superboss^Good job, boys. "Joe", you need to pick up the bracelet I have on order.
superboss^Make sure you get the right one, now. It's very important.
goon1^C'mon Joe, we're off to the best jewelry shop in town!
jack^Why didn't we go to the best one the first time?
goon1^...
goon2^It's the best for bracelets, he means.
goon1^It's the best chance you have now, I mean. Let's go.

goon1^Alright Joe, now you can see this place just has the one case.
goon2^So we'll have to work together. Get eachother's backs.
goon1^With that said, we need you to take lookout.
goon1^See, this case is locked, and it's hard to get into. So cover us.

ladyh4^Oh, boys, this one is so gorgeous!
ladyh4^Yes, yes, oh, I feel so beautiful!
ladyh4^And yet...
lady^I feel like all this gold draws attention away from, you know, my face area!
lady^What I mean to say is, get me a necklace.
superboss^Yes, a necklace! I have one on order.
superboss^It's quite special, and Joe is headed to get it for you.
shake^2,120^superboss^RIGHT NOW.
superboss^I don't need to express to you, Joe, how important this is to me.
superboss^I don't need to explain how this is your big chance.
superboss^I don't need to tell you to get this right, or else.

lady^These are something you'd see a call-girl wearing!
lady^Is that how you think of me?
superboss^No, no, of course not, my dear. There must have been a mix up.
shake^2,120^superboss^Joe, you collosal screwup.
superboss^I ask you to do one simple thing.
superboss^Just one. A simple thing.
superboss^Just make my lady happy, and all would be forgiven!
superboss^But you couldn't even do that, could you.
superboss^So now, from the kindness of my heart, I give you a week.
shake^2,120^superboss^Just one.
superboss^To make things right. Pay back what you owe.
superboss^Or the interest will be...
shake^2,120^superboss^quite steep.
lady^Aw, you're so kind and caring!
superboss^I know, darling. Now let's head off for the night.

goon1^Well you really screwed things up, Joe.
goon2^Yeah, really.
goon1^Better get out of here and work on some kind of repayment plan.
goon1^And you can keep the gun. I noticed you didn't grab your bullet from the last place.
goon2^Oh, yeah, that gun will be your problem now!
goon1^So long, Joe.

none^Well, this is it then. There's no way I can make back what I owe in a week.
none^With no job.
none^I should have pocketed some of that damn loot!
none^Where the hell can I get some fast cash?
none^I can't just walk into a bank and ask.
joe^Or can I?
none^Sure, I can just walk into a bank, head to the teller, flash the gun.
none^Nobody has to get hurt.
none^What other options do I have? None.
none^And a bank right ahead on the corner. It's a sign.

none^Okay, I just need to put a handkerchief over my face, walk up, take out the gun, ask for the money.

goon2^I think he may have been!
goon1^Wow, I knew you were an idiot, but this, I never imagined!
goon1^Look here, this is our city, understand?
goon1^We run this place. Hitting a bank here, that'd be like giving the Boss a black eye!
goon2^You're so lucky we happened to be here to stop you!
goon1^Hey, he's right! Imagine the trouble you'd be in.
